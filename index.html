    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>The U.S. is the epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Modeling studies suggest that, without mitigation efforts, rising numbers of COVID-19 cases may overwhelm the health system’s capacity and result in millions of deaths. As a result, federal, state, and local governments have implemented a patchwork of public health measures to slow transmission through “social distancing.”</p>
    
    <p>The effectiveness of social distancing policies requires significant engagement from communities. However, many communities face structural barriers that prevent them from successfully adhering to these policies. These barriers include employment constraints, economic security, and average education.</p>
