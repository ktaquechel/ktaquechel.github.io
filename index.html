    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>The U.S. is the epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Modeling studies suggest that, without mitigation efforts, rising numbers of COVID-19 cases may overwhelm the health system’s capacity and result in millions of deaths. As a result, federal, state, and local governments have implemented a patchwork of public health measures to slow transmission through “social distancing.”</p>
    
    <p>The effectiveness of social distancing policies requires significant engagement from communities. However, many communities face structural barriers that prevent them from successfully adhering to these policies. These barriers include employment constraints, economic security, and average education.</p>
    
    <p>In this interactive model, you can see how much Americans are engaging in social distancing, as well as which socioeconomic indicators correlate with changes in county average mobility. Importantly, the regression model adjusts for the effects of different indicators, allowing us to evaluate their relative influence.</p>
    
    <p>We measure social distancing as county-level averages of distance traveled per person over the last ten days. Unacast estimates these averages using 15-17 million anonymized cell phone records, relative to matched days of a pre-COVID-19 reference week. The model regularly updates with new data. County-level socioeconomic characteristics were obtained from the American Community Survey (5-year averages from 2014-2018) and Census.</p>
