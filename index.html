    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>The U.S. is the epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Early modeling studies suggested that, without mitigation efforts, rising numbers of COVID-19 cases may overwhelm the health system&rsquo;s capacity and result in millions of deaths. As a result, federal, state, and local governments have implemented a patchwork of public health measures to slow transmission through &ldquo;social distancing.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>The effectiveness of social distancing policies requires significant engagement from communities. However, many communities face structural barriers that may prevent them from successfully adhering to these policies. These barriers include employment constraints, educational attainment, and the rurality of their community.</p>
    
    <p>In this dynamic model, you can see how much Americans are engaging in social distancing over the last 10 days, as well as which socioeconomic characteristics correlate with changes in average county movement. Importantly, the regression model adjusts for the effects of each characteristic, allowing us to evaluate their relative influence.</p>
    
    <p>We measure social distancing as changes in county-level averages of distance traveled per person. <a href="https://www.unacast.com/covid19">Unacast</a> estimates these averages using 15&ndash;17 million anonymized cell phone records, relative to matched days of a pre-COVID-19 reference week. The model regularly updates with new data. County-level socioeconomic characteristics were obtained from the American Community Survey (5-year averages from 2014&ndash;2018) and Census.</p>

    <h2>Social Distancing among U.S. Counties</h2>
    
    <p>The vast majority of counties in the U.S. are engaging in some degree of social distancing. This graph depicts changes in daily movement since March 1, 2020, relative to matched days of a pre-COVID-19 reference week. Each line represents a single county. Negative values indicate more social distancing, or less movement, in the county.</p>

      <p>The highlighted grey area indicates the 10-day period that we use to model socioeconomic determinants of social distancing in our analyses. A 10-day period helps ensure that uncommon events and random variations in measurement do not bias our estimates.</p>

    <h2>Socioeconomic Correlates of Social Distancing</h2>
    
    <p>Existing research has documented the many ways in which <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2011.0685">socioeconomic status impacts health</a>. Reduced economic opportunity hampers a community&rsquo;s ability to take protective measures, which is relevant during a pandemic. For example, people of lower-income may be less able to take days off of work or have a job that permits off-site work.</p>
    
    <p>Here, we plot two measures of a county's socioeconomic status against its change in average movement: per capita income and share of residents with a college degree. As before, negative values for change in movement indicate more social distancing.</p>
